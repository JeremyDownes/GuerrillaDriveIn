<p style="color:black;">Guerilla Drive-In is a grass roots movie viewing group. </br>
It is the goal of this organization to create an environment</br>
where our patrons can enjoy cinema without corporate intrusion.</br>
We strive to bring back the notion of theater as a community event</br>
and we do so through the unique vehicle of a by-gone era...</br>
The Drive-in Theater</br>

Guerilla Drive-in theater cells are forming now in your city !</br>
Operative are encouraged to show independant, forgotten, and "B" movies.</br>

Donations can be accepted and concessions are encouraged. </br>
